        <!-- This paragraph contains a couple of fun facts about me -->
        <p> Hi, My name is <b> Maddie </b>. I am currently 16 years old. My birthday was January 4th. I just started driving and will be getting my lisence at the begining of July. My favorite color is blue and my favorite number is three. I love dogs, as I have a golden retriever named Sandie. I also love the movie <i> Maze Runner </i>. </p>
        <!-- This paragraph is about my favorite sport, swimming -->
        <p> One of my favorite things to do is swimming. I have been swimming for eight years. I have met some of my closest friends through swimming. I swim for Padua and Ridley Rays YMCA. Swimming is very fun and I don't know what I would do without it. </p> <blockquote> "A champion is not defined by their wins, but by how they can recover when they fall" </blockquote>
        <!-- This paragraph is about my family -->
        <p> I come from a happy family of five. My dad's name is James but he goes by Jim. He lived in New York for most of his life but moved to Pennsylvania at about age twenty eight. He loves to ski and was a swimmer for most of his life. My Mom's name is Linda. Her favorite color is yellow and she loves to cook. She is super sweet and kind. I have two sisters. One older and one younger. Thier names are Samantha and Courtney. We get alone most of the time but every now and then we have our fights. Both of them love to dance and annoy me. Overall, I love my family and I am very lucky to have them. </p>
